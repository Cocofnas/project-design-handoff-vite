# Design Handoff Project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I started looking at the project and then laid a structure and went on doing it component by component mobile first and then tablet and desktop. I used modals for tge pop up, a carousel for the membercards and the features which I never used before and that was a bit tricky. If i Had more time I would try to understand why I can't get the featurs to be a 100% and also why I can't get the membercards to display differently in tablet and desktop.
